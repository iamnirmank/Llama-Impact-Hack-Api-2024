# Codev Backend (Hackathon Prototype)

The backend service for **Codev**, an AI-powered developer teammate that enhances software development workflows by integrating with Discord and a planned VS Code extension. This hackathon prototype demonstrates key features, including AI-powered code generation and debugging, but is not yet fully integrated with the frontend.

---

## Project Status: 50% Complete

This project was developed under tight time constraints during a hackathon. While key backend functionalities have been implemented, the integration with the frontend and some advanced features remain incomplete.

---

## Key Features (Backend)

1. **AI-Powered Assistance**:
   - Processes user queries to generate relevant responses using Groq and LangChain.
   - Includes support for contextual code generation and debugging.

2. **Chat History and Context**:
   - Stores user queries, responses, and context in a database.
   - Retrieves relevant chat history and document context for enhanced responses.

3. **Document Chunking and Retrieval**:
   - Implements text chunking with overlap for preserving context.
   - Uses FAISS indexing for efficient similarity search and context retrieval.

4. **API for Frontend Integration**:
   - Provides endpoints for generating responses and retrieving chat history.
   - Ready for integration with the [Codev Frontend](https://github.com/iamnirmank/Llama-Impact-Hack-App-2024).

5. **Scalable and Modular Design**:
   - Designed to allow easy addition of new features and integration points.

## Completed Work

- **Backend Logic**:
  - Implemented core functionality for handling chat queries and generating AI responses.
  - Developed utility modules for document processing, FAISS indexing, and context retrieval.

- **AI Integration**:
  - Utilized Groq for AI-powered response generation.
  - Leveraged LangChain's prompt templates for query and context preparation.

- **API Endpoints**:
  - Created an endpoint for generating responses based on user queries.
  - Implemented chat history management and context extraction.

- **Frontend Prototype**:
  - [Frontend repository](https://github.com/iamnirmank/Llama-Impact-Hack-App-2024) completed but not yet integrated with the backend.

## Pending Work

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - Connect the API endpoints with the frontend for a unified user experience.

2. **Advanced AI Features**:
   - Enhance query handling with additional contextual understanding.
   - Add multi-turn conversation support.

3. **VS Code Extension**:
   - Integrate backend APIs with a planned VS Code extension for real-time code assistance.

4. **Authentication and User Management**:
   - Implement user authentication and session handling.

5. **Database Enhancements**:
   - Refine database schema for scalability and advanced analytics.

## Vision

Codev aims to transform the way developers collaborate by introducing an AI-powered teammate. By integrating with Discord and development tools like VS Code, Codev will provide intelligent assistance throughout the development process, from brainstorming to debugging.

Though currently in its prototype phase, Codev has laid the foundation for an innovative and scalable solution. We look forward to completing and refining the project to achieve its full potential.
